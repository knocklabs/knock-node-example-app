# **Knock + Node.js example app**

This example app uses [Knock](https://knock.app) to power cross channel notifications via email and an in-app feed inside of a full-stack Node application, written in [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/). It uses the [Knock Node SDK](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-node) and [React in-app feed components](https://github.com/knocklabs/react-notification-feed).

You can read more about this example app [in the Knock documentation](https://docs.knock.app/getting-started/example-app).

## Running locally

First, configure the environment variables properly (see the bottom of this README).

Then run:

```
yarn blitz prisma migrate dev
```

Then, let's get the database populated with seed data by running:

```
yarn blitz db seed
```

Finally, we can start the development server by running:

```
yarn blitz dev
```

You can take a look at the seed users credentials in the seed file in order to log in; all starter passwords are "password".

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment variables

See the `.env.sample` and `.env.test.sample` files for the env variables needed.

Here's more context on where to find the Knock variables:

- [Knock API keys](https://docs.knock.app/developer-tools/api-keys)
- [Knock in-app feed channel ID](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/react/feed#getting-started)

## Using the example app

Before you run the example app locally, you'll need to [sign up for a Knock account](https://dashboard.knock.app/signup) to configure channels and workflows for the app to work as expected.

Once you've created your Knock account you will need to create:

1. Email and in-app feed channels
2. A workflow in Knock with the key `welcome`. It should include an email step for your welcome email template.
3. A workflow in Knock with the key `new-comment`. It should include: an in-app feed step and an email step. On these step's templates you can use the following variables which the example app is already configured to send as arguments on the workflow trigger call:
   1. `comment_content`: The content of the created comment.
   2. `asset_name`: The name of the commented asset.
   3. `asset_url`: The url of the commented asset.
   4. `project_name`: The name of the project that the comment asset belongs to.
4. A workflow in Knock with the key `new-asset`. It should include: an in-app feed step and an email step. On these step's templates you can use the following variables which the example app is already configured to send as arguments on the workflow trigger call:
   1. asset_url: The url of the commented asset.
   2. project_name: The name of the project that the comment asset belongs to.

Once you've seeded your Knock account with `yarn blitz db seed` and created the above workflows in Knock, you can use the app locally and trigger Knock workflows to send notifications from the example app.

**ðŸš€ Tip: auto-create workflows with the CLI ðŸš€** <br> The example app repo contains a `knock/workflows` directory with the three workflows listed above. You can use the [Knock CLI](https://docs.knock.app/cli) to push these workflows into your Knock account using the `knock workflow push --all` command.

## TODO: Add Knock

### Practice implementing the Knock on this branch

This branch of the Knock example app doesn't have Knock added yet. Throughout the files, you'll see the logical spaces to add calls marked with the comment `TODO: ADD KNOCK`. When added, this application will be able to do the following:

1. [Identify users on Knock](https://docs.knock.app/managing-recipients/identifying-recipients)
2. [Trigger workflows on Knock](https://docs.knock.app/send-notifications/triggering-workflows)
3. [Inline identify users](https://docs.knock.app/reference#trigger-workflow-inline-identify)
4. [Set user preferences on Knock](https://docs.knock.app/managing-recipients/setting-preferences)
5. [Render a notification feed](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/react/feed)

### Recommended order of steps

Setup: make sure you go through the steps in `Using the example app` above to make sure you have a Knock account with the required workflows and you have your environment variables available here.

1. Identify users as they log in
2. Trigger the following workflows and inline-identify the recipients:
   - `welcome` workflow for new users who sign up (`/signup.ts`)
   - `new-asset` workflow when an asset is added (`/createAsset.ts`)
   - `new-comment` workflow when a comment is added (`/createComment.ts`)
3. Let users set preferences for their notifications
4. Add the notification feed
